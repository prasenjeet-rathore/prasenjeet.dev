Welcome to the source code for my personal blog and portfolio. This is where I'm documenting my journey of learning in public, building projects, and transitioning from a background in Credit Risk to a hands-on role in Cloud Engineering.
The central theme of this blog is the development of my flagship project: an **"Area Intelligence" application** built with a modern Python and cloud-native stack. I'll be sharing the challenges, architectural decisions, and learnings along the way.
